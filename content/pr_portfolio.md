I worked on this PR project during my time at Elliot & Co as part of their internal branding campaign. This project focused on delivering the founding story of Elliot & Co's founder, highlighting the personal and professional struggles he faced.

I worked on this LinkedIn project during my stint in Elliot & Co for their client [Chandler Institute of Governance](https://www.chandlerinstitute.org). The project invovled working with the team at CIG and an external designer to plan, ideate,propose, and execute social media posts across their Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles. 

The deliverables included a short write-up accompanied by either a static or video visual.

The first campaign consisted of 8 posts across a 3-month campaign. Satisfied with the output generated, the CIG team extended our campiagn for another 3 months to cover the launch of their new 2022 Good Government Index.

I've also worked on individual LinkedIn profiles for clients. These projects included a complete overhaul of the LinkedIn profile - rewriting the 'About Me' synopsis and other sections of their profiles.

The second section invovled fiding interesting articles that are relevant to their individual fields and writing a short paragraph conveying the client's thoughts and opinions. 

These projects invovled a lot of correspondence with the clients - usually invovling vetting rounds for the selection of the article as well as the short write-up.

As part of the campaign, we also offered clients the option of lead-generation through LinkedIn with the use of SalesNav and Expandi.

# [Bread & Butter of PR]

My day-to-day work during my stint in Elliot & Co invovled meeting clients, proposing campaigns, compiling media lists, writing press releases and media pitches.
